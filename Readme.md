# Asset Tech Smart Contract 

This here is our take on the first smart contract.

### The Problem:

>To make a solidity smart contact
>That converts Asset Tech code to a digitized Smart Contract

### Working

The code we have worked on, takes input of bank names and assigns respective ids to them\
The same is done for different sectors.\
Once that's done we take input from user for a particular transaction and ask for filling all the required fields.\
We check if the bank name and sector name have already been inputted before hand and their respective ids are generated, and then save the transaction in a digitized smart contract.

## TODO
1. Writing the digitzed smart contract to a csv
	>For Which a frontend side looks seemingly unavoidable
2. If possible taking input of all fields from a spreadsheet instead of from a person.
	>The same as above frontened is unavoidable
